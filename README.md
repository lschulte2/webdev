# Web Application Development

This is a series of practical lessons for web application development. The goal of this series is to get you started with web application development using the PHP and JavaScript languages and the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) application frameworks. If you are looking for a more general and in-depth introduction to web application development, take a look at [the MDN learning area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).

Please work through the lessons in order, as each lesson builds upon the previous lessons. At the end you will build a basic web application with user accounts, persistent storage in a database and an interactive user interface for basic image annotation.

## Preparation

All instructions are written to be performed on a Linux command line (e.g. Ubuntu). They should also work fine on a Mac. If you use Windows, you could try to use the [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

The practical lessons require PHP >=8.0 installed on your system. To install it on Ubuntu 22.04, run:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php-cli
```
